                       <p>Answer         : JavaScript  is a scripting language that enables us to create dynamically

                       everything else.

                       <p>Answer         : The V8 JavaScript engine is an open-source, high-performance JavaScript and 
                       WebAssembly engine developed by the Chromium project for the Google
                       Chrome browser. It's written in C++ and is designed to execute JavaScript code

                       <p>Answer         : JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is responsible for 
                       executing the code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued 
                       Sub-tasks.

                       <p>Answer         : JavaScript is indeed single-threaded, meaning it has only one execution thread. 
                       However, it utilizes an asynchronous programming model to handle tasks that 
                       may take some time to complete, such as Fetch or network requests. This is 
                       achieved through mechanisms like callbacks, Promises, and the async/await 
                      syntax.

                       <p>Answer         : Regular functions are synchronous and return values directly, on the other hand
                       async functions allow for more readable and concise handling of asynchronous 
                       operations. They always return a promise, and the use of await simplifies working 
                       with promises.

                       that the operation was completed successfully. Rejected state : meaning that the 
                       operation failed.

                       <p>
                       In JavaScript, a closure is a combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared. This combination allows the function to retain access to variables from its containing scope even after that scope has closed or finished executing.
